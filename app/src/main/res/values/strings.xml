        Please place clothes in 13 gallon bags (Washboard bags or 13 gallon plastic kitchen bags).
        Each bag will be washed as an individual load, so please sort with like colors as desired.
        \n
        \n
Place delicates and hang dry items in a separate bag inside the 13 gallon bag.
        These will be given special care and hung dry instead of placed in the dryer, then folded and returned with the rest of the load.
        Hang dry and delicates will accrue an additional charge of $1 each.
        \n
        \n
All laundry is washed with Tide and OxyClean.
        Fabric softener will be added as requested (not recommended for towels).
        Fabric softener can not be added to only part of a load, please separate into separate bags as necessary.
        We use "x" fabric softener.
        \n
        \n
All laundry not set aside as delicate or hang dry will be dried on medium heat then folded.
